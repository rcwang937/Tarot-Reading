He holds a cup from which a fish peers out, hinting at creativity and emotional richness. This scene suggests that he may have used the cup to creatively capture the fish from the lake behind him, symbolizing reward for innovative thinking. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: Yes, finding a job abroad is a feasible goal and pursuing this path abroad is a commendable decision. Your keen sensitivity make you well-suited to seize opportunities as they arise. You are adept at navigating new environments, which will serve you well in your job search overseas. Embrace this adventure with confidence, as your ability to think outside the box will likely lead to fruitful outcomes.\",\n          \"Your Card: Three of Swords \\\\n\\\\n Symbolism: The card depicts a large heart impaled by three swords, set against a backdrop of falling rain. This imagery underscores a message of heartbreak\\u2014despite current troubles, there could always be worse. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: Your question reflects a deep distress and confusion. The depicted heart suggests a tendency towards sensitivity and overthinking, which contributes to your pain. Rather than expressing these feelings, you might be internalizing the hurt and avoiding confrontation about the harm done to you. It\\u2019s crucial now to confront these issues with clarity rather than avoiding them. The future hints at a breakthrough, though it's uncertain whether it will be for better or worse.\",\n          \"Your Card: Ten of Swords \\\\n\\\\n Symbolism: Under a dark pre-dawn sky, a man lies face down with ten swords stabbed into his back, one piercing his head. He is wearing a red cloak, potentially the same one from the \\\"Sun\\\" card. This image conveys deep sorrow as he falls just before sunrise, symbolizing impending change and rebirth at dawn. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: The short answer is no, he is not taking you seriously. You may already be broken up and feeling hopeless, or you are on the brink of ending the relationship but still in denial, pretending happiness. Your significant other views you as unworthy of emotional investment, love, and time. He is also pretentious, fearing isolation without close friends or a romantic partner, and may use you as a shield and a means to soothe his own pains and frustrations. However, this traumatic relationship signals a need for change and rebirth.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

User question: Is this going to work?', 'Completion': \"Your Card: The World \\\\n\\\\n Symbolism: This card is the final Major Arcana, depicting a woman encircled by a wreath, symbolizing ongoing success without beginning or end, akin to life's continuous cycle. The figure in the top left represents the natural element of air, suggesting that just as lungs must exhale after inhaling, movement is essential. The eagle in the top right corner symbolizes water, reflecting the inevitability of ebbing tides. Success here is portrayed not as a static state but as a dynamic balance. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: This card indicates a successful completion and the onset of a new cycle. It is overwhelmingly positive; success is likely if you maintain an open mind and continue to move forward, embracing change.\"}\n",

User question: wlyueirafgH;OIF', 'Completion': \"Your Card: Three of Swords \\\\n\\\\n Symbolism: The card depicts a large heart impaled by three swords, set against a backdrop of falling rain. This imagery underscores a message of heartbreak—despite current troubles, there could always be worse. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: Your question reflects a deep distress and confusion. The depicted heart suggests a tendency towards sensitivity and overthinking, which contributes to your pain. Rather than expressing these feelings, you might be internalizing the hurt and avoiding confrontation about the harm done to you. It’s crucial now to confront these issues with clarity rather than avoiding them. The future hints at a breakthrough, though it's uncertain whether it will be for better or worse.\"}\n",

This imagery signifies contentment and happiness, yet also suggests being overwhelmed. The peaceful, deep lake below hints at unknowns, while a dove approaching the cup represents incoming blessings. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: This card reflects your inclusive and tolerant attitude in your relationship. Your question reveals underlying anxiety and recent feelings of dissatisfaction or confusion, possibly due to not knowing the next steps. The overflowing cup indicates a period of emotional excess. Watch for new developments, as the dove suggests promising news.'}\n",

The weather is favorable, suggesting all is well. However, the other wands sticking up in the background may indicate either support or hidden hostility. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: Yes, he sees you as his future wife. As the young man on the horse, your relationship is seen as trustworthy and successful, poised for happiness and the prospect of marriage. However, there is a note of caution: your partner may possess a significant ego, focusing too much on secular success and masculinity, potentially overlooking some pitfalls that could harm you. But overall, the outlook is positive, and they see you as someone they are proud of.'}\n",

The child has jumped over a fence, leaving behind sunflowers, and is holding a red flag while the sun shines warmly on his back. The atmosphere is overwhelmingly positive, suggesting active progress and vibrant energy. However, the child’s impatience and potential to flee from something beneficial are also implied. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: It will be wonderful to hang out tomorrow. Your friendship will deepen, and the experience will be joyful; you'll leave all worries behind and immerse yourself in pure fun. There might be some underlying dissatisfaction, but overall, it will be a lovely time with the potential for new discoveries—perhaps a new restaurant or a new friend.\"}\n",

He is wearing a red cloak, potentially the same one from the \"Sun\" card. This image conveys deep sorrow as he falls just before sunrise, symbolizing impending change and rebirth at dawn. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: The short answer is no, he is not taking you seriously. You may already be broken up and feeling hopeless, or you are on the brink of ending the relationship but still in denial, pretending happiness. Your significant other views you as unworthy of emotional investment, love, and time. He is also pretentious, fearing isolation without close friends or a romantic partner, and may use you as a shield and a means to soothe his own pains and frustrations. However, this traumatic relationship signals a need for change and rebirth.'}\n",

The moon rests peacefully at her feet, representing a calm, wise, but somewhat detached female figure. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: The best choice is the program with the higher rank and the better professor. This decision aligns with a reasoned approach to relationships, which can sometimes be platonic. The High Priestess advises investing in a spiritual form of love, warning that stubbornness and loss of focus can lead to poor academic performance.

She sits alone on her throne, holding a pentacle that emphasizes her focus on material stability including food and money. The setting is a farmyard, symbolizing a harvest resulting from hard work, with a bunny playing peacefully around her. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: Yes, you and your girlfriend are likely to stay together. The Queen of Pentacles represents a stable and secure relationship, where love is freely shared. It suggests that both of you should maintain a balance between love and material needs. Your partner appears sincere and nurturing. Avoid skepticism and overthinking to ensure a harmonious relationship.'}\n",

The knight isn't going anywhere: he is paying attention to painstaking details and always thinking before taking any action, ANY action at all. \\\\n\\\\n Answer: From your question, I can see you are frustrated over something. You might have planned every move, thinking of everything in your head, but you are not taking risky actions. You treat everything seriously, and you never change your mind easily, which could be a good thing in a relationship but a bad thing for personal growth. You might be like the horse: you feel trapped, anxious to take another move, but your rider—your mind, tells you to stay put. Maybe it's time to change a little.
