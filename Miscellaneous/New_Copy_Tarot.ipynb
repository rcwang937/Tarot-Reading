            "Individuals and their Symbolisms: The Devil is a rather complex card, embodying several symbolic elements. At its most fundamental, it represents a being of power and allure. It is often portrayed as a satyr or a goat-like creature, both associated with instinctual desires and animalistic traits - hedonism, lust, and addiction, which directly alligns with your keywords. He holds a flame-lit torch in one hand, symbolising the irresistible pull of desire and the light of seduction that attracts to the wrong path. The humans chained at his feet display the concept of manipulation, as they appear trapped but if you look closely, their chains are loose and can be taken off at any time. The chains represent the power of addiction or the illusion of being trapped but remind us that we always have the ability to free ourselves from the shackles if we choose so.\n",
            "\n",
            "Answer to your question: Dear little one, let me tell you a story about the fascinating Kira Yoshikage from the story JJBA Part 4. He, much like the figure on the Devil card, is undeniably attractive, and it is natural to feel a pull towards such charismatic figures. Just as Kira Yoshikage leads an intriguing life in the world of fiction, you too, will lead a life full of excitement and adventure in the real world. Remember always that you have the power within you to make your own choices and the choice is yours to write your own story. As you grow, take these feelings of admiration you currently feel, and channel them into becoming just as strong and alluring a personality as he is. But also remember the lesson of the Devil card - that while it is okay to admire and desire, one should never be manipulated or succumb to addiction. Let your feelings for Kira inspire you, but never let them rule your life.\n"
